## Information

**Project Name:** Tinkoff Backend Academy Homework 2 - Java Project with Maven and Gradle

**Description:**
This project is a simple Java application created using Maven and Gradle build tools. It demonstrates the basic setup and structure of a Java project with Maven and Gradle, including the creation of a controller, service, and test classes. The project also includes plugins for generating code coverage reports and Javadoc documentation during the build process.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Programming Language:** Java 17
- **Development Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Gradle
- **Version Control:** Git

**Key Features:**

- **Maven Project:** A Java project created using Maven build tool.
- **Gradle Project:** A Java project created using Gradle build tool.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Controller:** Contains REST endpoints for handling HTTP requests.
- **Service:** Contains business logic and data processing methods.
- **Test Classes:** Includes unit tests for the service class.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Build the Maven Project:** Run `mvn clean install` in the `maven-project` directory.
2. **Build the Gradle Project:** Run `gradlew myBuild` in the `gradle-project` directory.

**Project Goals:**

- Learn to create Java projects using Maven and Gradle build tools.
- Understand the structure of a Java project with Maven and Gradle.
- Practice using plugins for code coverage and Javadoc generation.

## Part 1. Implementation

1. Create 2 projects on mvn and gradle via start.spring.io
2. Add code with an already written controller, service, and test.
3. Add jacoco-maven-plugin and maven-javadoc-plugin plugins to build pages at the time of application build.
4. In the service, add a description of which build tool turned out to be simpler for this task and why
