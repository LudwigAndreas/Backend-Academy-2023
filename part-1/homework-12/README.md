## Information

**Project Name:** Tinkoff Backend Academy homework 12 - Refactoring project

**Description:**
In this homework, you need to refactor the project, improve the readability of the code, add tests to understand the contract, guess the version of Elasticsearch with which all this works, add the `docker-compose.yml` file to run the environment and test containers for integration tests.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Programming Language:** Java 17
- **Development Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Docker, Spring Boot, Postgres, Elasticsearch
- **Version Control:** Git

**Key Features:**

- **Refactoring project** - The project requires refactoring the code to improve its readability.
- **Unknown dependencies** - The project uses integration with Elasticsearch and Postgres, but there is no available documentation and information about the versions with which the project works.
- **Tests** - The project lacks tests, you need to add tests to understand the contract.
- **Docker** - To simplify running the environment and tests, you need to add the `docker-compose.yml` file and test containers for integration tests.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Code readability** - To improve the readability of the code, you need to refactor the code, improve the naming of variables, methods, and classes, and simplify the project structure.
- **Tests** - To understand the contract, you need to add tests that cover the main functions of the project.
- **Docker** - To simplify running the environment and tests, you need to add the `docker-compose.yml` file and test containers for integration tests.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Run the base-project and explore the project's operation.
2. Run the project after refactoring and check the identity of the project's operation.

**Project Goals:**

- Learn how to refactor code to improve its readability.
- Learn to work with projects that lack documentation and information about dependency versions.
- Learn to explore and understand the project contract by writing tests.
- Understand the principles of Docker and use Docker to simplify running the environment and tests.
- Learn to work with Elasticsearch and Postgres integration.

## Part 1. Implementation

Mandatory requirements:

1. Improve code readability
2. Add tests to understand the contract
3. Guess the version of elasticsearch and postgres with which all this works
4. Add a composer file to run the environment and test containers for integration tests.
5. The project lacks a database schema, research is required to understand what tables exist and what they do.
6. The project contains errors that need to be fixed. (distinguish errors from features)

## Part 2. Bonus

1. Add logging to the project
2. Add monitoring to the project
3. Add metrics to the project
4. Add documentation to the project
5. Add a CI/CD pipeline to the project
6. Add a auto-tests to the project
